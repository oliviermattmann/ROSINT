# ROSINT 

ROSINT is an ongoing project of mine to develop an Open Source Intelligence crawler with the Rust programming language.

The purpose for this project is for me to get more comfortable writing Rust code while also learning more about cyber and information security.

What kind of information is searched for is not yet clear but the goal is to generate a markdown report of the information found.
