# ROSINT 

ROSINT is an ongoing project of mine to develop an Open Source Intelligence crawler with the Rust programming language.

The purpose for this project is for me to get more comfortable writing Rust code while also learning more about cyber and information security.

The main idea is to provide a url and the crawler collects the data, puts it in a structured format and extracts further references/url collect even more information. Once url's have run out or a time limit is reached the collected information is exported as a report in markdown format.  

This project is mainly inspired by a chapter about OSINT crawlers in the book Black Hat Rust by Sylvain Kerkour. I haven't read the whole book yet but so far I can recommend it.
